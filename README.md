Ligation by plant and fungal RNA ligases yields an internal 2′-phosphate group on each RNA ligation product. Here, we define several unique signals produced by 2′-phosphorylated RNAs during nanopore sequencing:
* A 2′-phosphate at the splice junction of HAC1 mRNA inhibits 5′→3′ degradation, enabling detection of decay intermediates by 5′ end mapping in yeast RNA repair mutants.
* During direct RNA sequencing, intact 2′-phosphorylated RNAs produce diagnostic changes in nanopore current properties and base calling features.

This repository describes our general bioinformatic strategy for detecting 2′-phosphate signals, as well as the R markdown files used to generate the figures in the preprint.
